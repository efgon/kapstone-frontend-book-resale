    Description: `Using a simple five-minute base recipe, you can make the “brilliant” (Andrew Zimmern), “astonishingly good” (Ruth Reichl) flavors of the innovative “ice cream gods” (Bon Appétit) Salt & Straw at home. 
 
        NAMED ONE OF THE BEST COOKBOOKS OF THE SEASON BY Eater • Delish • Epicurious
        
        Based out of Portland, Oregon, Salt & Straw is the brainchild of two cousins, Tyler and Kim Malek, who had a vision but no recipes. They turned to their friends for advice—chefs, chocolatiers, brewers, and food experts of all kinds—and what came out is a super-simple base that takes five minutes to make, and an ice cream company that sees new flavors and inspiration everywhere they look.
         
        Using that base recipe, you can make dozens of Salt & Straw’s most beloved, unique (and a little controversial) flavors, including Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons, Roasted Strawberry and Toasted White Chocolate, and Buttered Mashed Potatoes and Gravy.
         
        But more importantly, this book reveals what they’ve learned, how to tap your own creativity, and how to invent flavors of your own, based on whatever you see around you. Because ice cream isn’t just a thing you eat, it’s a way to live.
        
        Praise for Salt & Straw Ice Cream Cookbook
        
        “Making ice cream at home is already enough of a mental hurdle. . . . Salt & Straw is out to prove us wrong with a new cookbook . . . making crazy ice cream flavors is more than doable—it’s addictive.”—Portland Monthly
        
        “The approachable, you-can-do-this nature of the book should be all that home cooks need to try it out.”—Eater
        
        “I originally sought out this book solely because of the Meyer Lemon Blueberry Buttermilk Custard. . . . It is the greatest ice cream flavor that’s ever existed and, because it’s only a seasonal flavor in their stores, I needed the recipe so I could make it whenever I wanted.”—Bon Appétit
        
        “A cookbook dedicated to ice cream? Yes, please. This is essential reading for Salt & Straw fans.”—Food & Wine
        
        “Few of America’s many ice cream makers are as seasonally minded and downright creative as Salt & Straw co-founder Tyler Malek.”—GrubStreet`,

This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie’s wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author’s original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man’s capacity for inhumanity to man.
            Night offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.`,

In paintings such as Sunflowers, The Starry Night, and Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear, we recognize an artist uniquely dexterous in the representation of texture and mood, light and place.
    Yet in his lifetime, van Gogh battled not only the disinterest of his contemporary audience but also devastating bouts of mental illness. His episodes of depression and anxiety would eventually claim his life, when, in 1890, he committed suicide shortly after his 37th birthday.
    This comprehensive study of Vincent van Gogh offers a complete catalogue of his 871 paintings, alongside writings and essays, charting the life and work of a master who continues to tower over art to this day.`,

    Description: `Now available in a paperback edition, this beautifully illustrated, delightfully informative collection of one hundred of the world’s most significant paintings covers nearly every period, culture, and style. What makes the Book of Kells such an extraordinary example of illuminated manuscript? Why is Dürer’s self-portrait so iconic? How did Turner’s Rain, Steam, Speed turn the art world on its head? What’s so great about Jasper John’s Flag? And who was Whistler’s mother, anyway? Art history is filled with paintings that shocked, intrigued, enraged, and mystified their audiences—paintings that exemplified the period in which they were created and forever changed the way we think. Here, one hundred examples of these icons of art are presented in beautiful, high-quality reproductions. Each double-page spread features lavish illustrations and details as well as engaging texts that explain why the painting belongs in the pantheon of world changing art.`,
